## Requirement Page Project

The Requirement Page Project serves the purpose of agreeing to agreements. Each feed is sorted by timestamp and is accessible only on Replit. It verifies users using the Replit username retrieved from the `getUsernameDetail` function to store user values. Here are the basic usage instructions for this project:

1. **Accessing the Requirement Page:**
   - Visit the project page on Replit to access the Requirement Page.

2. **Agreeing to Agreements:**
   - Once on the Requirement Page, users can review and agree to agreements presented.

3. **Timestamp Sorting:**
   - Feeds are sorted by timestamp,
4. **Verification Mechanism:**
   - The project verifies users using the Replit username obtained from the `/api/user-info` function.

## Usage of Additional Functions

### 1. Adding Users
##### You can add a user by calling the `add_user()` function:
```python


username = "yourusername"
add_user(username)
```

### 2. Checking Completion Status
#### To check if a user has agreed to all requirements, you can use the following endpoint:
```bash

GET /api/validate/<username>
```

### 3. Updating Requirements
#### To update requirements, you can use the `update_requirement()` function:


```python

category = "category_name"
description = "description_text"
update_requirement(category, description, db)
```


### 4. Loading Categories from File
#### To load categories from a file, use the `load_categories_from_file()` function:

```python

 # by default the file name was file.json Replace "categories.json" with the path to your categories file.
filename = "file.json"
load_categories_from_file(db, filename)
```


### Additionally, when adding new items, they will be placed in a new category if the category does not exist. Otherwise, they will be added to the existing category. Categories may accumulate over time as new items are added.
